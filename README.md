# Section 5 â€“ Refactoring Code Smells in Practice

Identified Code Smell:

1. Magic Strings, where the value names are too simple like alphebets
   i updated them with better names
2. Duplicating codes, where there are same code for updating ui.
   I updated them to a new function so everytime to update ui is to just call a function.
3. The setup function is too long, so i splited it into different small functions.
   So now the setup function is clean and easy to read.
